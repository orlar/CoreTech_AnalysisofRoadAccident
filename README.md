# CoreTech_AnalysisofRoadAccident
To overcome the limitations of unstructured raw accident data, which currently prevents stakeholders at CoreTech from gaining actionable insights, in my role as a Data Scientist, I performed statistical analysis and created an informative dashboard that improves data comprehension, prepared a comprehensive powerpoint presentation emphasizing on the critical need for data-driven road safety measures.

Problem Statement:

Road accidents are a major public safety concern affected by multiple variables. The current unstructured format of accident data limits our ability to derive actionable insights. Consequently, stakeholders lack the clear visualizations and analysis needed for informed decisions, emphasizing the critical need for data-driven road safety measures.


Project Objectives: This project aims to:

- Clean and Standardize the Accident Dataset: Correct missing, inconsistent, and duplicate values; ensure proper formatting of dates, times, locations, and categorical variables.
- Analyze Accident Frequency and Severity: Determine the total number of accidents per year, month, and day; assess the distribution of severity levels (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
- Identify High-Risk Factors: Analyze the impact of speed limits, road conditions, and weather on accident severity; evaluate the influence of time of day, light conditions, and urban vs. rural areas.
- Perform Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Compute mean, median, and standard deviation of key accident variables.
- Develop an Interactive Excel Dashboard: Create charts, graphs, and heatmaps to visualize accident trends and patterns; implement filters and dynamic visualizations for efficient data exploration.
- Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Identify accident hotspots and propose traffic safety interventions; suggest policy measures, infrastructure improvements, and public awareness strategies to reduce accidents.

Techniques used:
Data cleaning - check for missing and duplicate values, remove ans substitute unprintable characters, formatting categorical variables
